What's New
--------------------------------------

(4th October 2017)

History Guess -
    There's a new configurable key called "history-guess". When pressed, it tries to complete current line
    bases on the previous line. Dror hopes to work on this feature more and significantly reduce the amount of
    typing we all do while working. Defaults to Control-P on Linux.

    Example:
        >>> x = 1
        >>> y = 2
        >>> z = 3
        [... more code ...]
        >>> x = 1
        [press history-guess, and the following is automatically completed]
        >>> y = 2
        [press history-guess again, and the following is automatically completed]
        >>> z = 3

    Amazing.


SmartSuggest -
    A new extension that chaches all symbols in all modules from all pythons path directories. Once initialized,
    module/class/function suggestions include symbols that aren't imported. Simply enable from config dialog.

    Example:
        >>> walk('my_dir')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <interactive>
            walk
        NameError: name 'walk' is not defined

        Here are some import suggestions:
        (F) from ast import walk
        (F) from os import walk

    The words are links, so you can just move cursor to the right symbol with keystrokes and press enter to import.


PatchTkinter -
    New extension to safeguard from Tkinter crashes. It turns out that Tkinter and threads and stuff don't work
    so well. This extension replaces some delete function in Tkinter classes, hoping to prevent them from being
    called from the wrong thread. This has been working on Dror's computer for much success for about a month.
    Simply enable from config dialog.


SublimeText Word Jumping -
    Moving (sub)words to the left/right using Control/Alt keys is now similar to the use case in the SublimeText
    editor. Ofir asked for this, and it really makes more sense. The keys are configurable in the config dialog.


CustomizePrompt -
    An extension that allows the prompt, i.e. ">>>", to be changed. The format is configurable from the config dialog,
    with more information there.

    Examples:
        Setting `prompt-format` to "[%H:%M:%S]" shows the time when the prompt was printed:
        [19:53:05] sum(i for i in range(100000000))
        4999999950000000
        [19:53:39]

        Setting `prompt-format` to "[%dM:%dS.%df]" shows how much time the last statement took:
        [00:00.00] sum(i for i in range(100000000))
        ... 4999999950000000
        [00:04.75]

        It took 5.75 seconds to compute! Gauss would be faster.


ResourceStatus -
    When enabled, a new timer now shows in the status bar for every run statement. It's just a nice small addition.
